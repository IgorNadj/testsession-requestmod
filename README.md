# Request Modification extension to the Test Session module 

## Overview

*IMPORTANT: This module is intended for development and testing, it poses a security risk if used on production servers.*
*It's completely possible to allow any user to become an admin, or do other nefarious things, if this is installed on a live site*

## Usage

/dev/testsession form will have two additional functions: 
- Throttling (request delay)
- Forcing a specific response (response override)

For more information follow the instructions in testsession's README
